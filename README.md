In prediction (or Information) markets participants trade in contracts whose payoff depends on future events. In a truly efficient prediction market, the price of a contract will be the best predictor of the related event.

## Instructions
Fulfill requirements:
```
pip3 install pandas matplotlib
```
Run default parameters (100 agents, 50 iterations):
```
python3 hello_world.py
```
To manually input parameters follow the example:
```
python3 hello_world.py -n 100 -i 50
```
